\section{Motivation}

\section{Aims}
The aim of this work is the development of a tool which takes one or more RSS feeds and generates usable metro maps with a rich interactive display format, which represent articles as stations and topics as train lines, reducing information overload by providing contextual links and background within the visualisation itself.

The resultant system is a news feed aggregator with graphically structured visual output, and to the best of my knowledge is first of its kind.
