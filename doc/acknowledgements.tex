Firstly, I'd like to thank Professor Stephen Payne for his supervision, advice, and cheerful weekly repetition of the phrase ``Just carry on!'' Without his guidance and encouragement, this project would not have been possible. 

I also have to thank my parents for their unending love and support, as well as the sacrifices they've made over the years for me and my education.

Last but not least, thank you to all my of friends both in Bath and in London, for keeping me sane this year, for letting me ramble about tube maps for hours, and for the constant supply of sweets.
