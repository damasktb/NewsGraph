Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said \"Brexit means Brexit\" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38641208\" class=\"story-body__link\">in her key speech on Brexit.</a></p><p class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n         \n    </p>\n<h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What about the economy?</h2><p>The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What is the European Union?</h2><p>The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries <a href=\"http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">(click here if you want to see the full list)</a>. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. </p><p>It has since grown to become a \"single market\" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zgjwtyc\" class=\"story-body__link\">Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.</a></p>\n        <p class=\"media-player-wrapper\">\n            \n        </p>\n    <p class=\"off-screen\">Media caption</p>How does the European Union work?\n<h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">So when will Britain actually leave it?</h2><p>For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called <a href=\"http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty</a> which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What about the Supreme Court's decision on Article 50?</h2><p>After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Who is going to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU?</h2>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n                \n            </span>\n                <p class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</p>\n                <p class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    David Davis has been appointed Secretary of State for Brexit\n                </p>\n            \n            \n        <p>Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?</h2><p>Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. </p><p>EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.</p>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n            </span><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Why will Brexit take so long?</h2><p>Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">The likely focus of negotiations between the UK and EU</h2><p>Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.</p><p>Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services\" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a \"comprehensive free trade deal\" giving the UK \"the greatest possible access\" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38654147\" class=\"story-body__link\">Reality Check: How could customs union work?</a></p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What do \"soft\" and \"hard\" Brexit mean?</h2><p>These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.</p><p>So at one extreme, \"hard\" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a \"soft\" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?</h2><p>The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the \"will of Parliament\", he added.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?</h2><p>A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK?</h2><p>Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-rights/brexit/brexit/?utm_content=buffer02ff2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Citizens' Advice has reminded people</a> their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.</p><p>Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a \"surge\" in new arrivals.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?</h2>\n        <p class=\"media-player-wrapper\">\n            \n        </p>\n    <p class=\"off-screen\">Media caption</p>Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending\n<p>People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. </p><p>This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.</p><p>The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will immigration be cut?</h2>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">PA</p>\n                \n            </span><p>Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.</p><p>She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.</p><p>Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a \"sustainable\" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Could there be a second referendum? </h2>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n            </span><p>It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.</p><p>Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?</h2><p>Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will I need a visa to travel to the EU? </h2><p>While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.</p>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Reuters</p>\n                \n            </span><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will I still be able to use my passport?</h2><p>Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03ntm8x\" class=\"story-body__link\">the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.</a></p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Some say we could still remain in the single market - but what is a single market? </h2><p>The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. </p><p>Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.</p><p>The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. </p><p>It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a \"level playing field\". </p><p>Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36083664\" class=\"story-body__link\">Read more: A free trade area v EU single market</a></p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Has any other member state ever left the EU?</h2><p>No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35233683\" class=\"story-body__link\"> visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.</a></p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What does this mean for Scotland?</h2>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Reuters</p>\n                \n            </span>\n                <p class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</p>\n                <p class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely\n                </p>\n            \n            \n        <p>Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is \"democratically unacceptable\" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now \"highly likely\", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market \"undoubtedly\" brings the referendum closer.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What does it mean for Northern Ireland?</h2><p>Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be \"very profound\" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn F&#233;in for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?</h2><p>During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called \"triple lock\" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.</p><p>So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?</h2>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Thinkstock</p>\n                \n            </span><p>Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an \"upside\" or \"silver lining\" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the \"customs union\" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.</p><p>Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be \"an incredible boost for my business\" but he later said  that remark had been \"light-hearted\". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote \"it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.\"  </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will EHIC cards still be valid?</h2><p>They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will cars need new number plates?</h2><p>Probably not, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03wc3yp\" class=\"story-body__link\">says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris</a>, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Could MPs block an EU exit?</h2><p>Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.</p><p>The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, <a href=\"file:///D:/Downloads/RP13-42.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">according to a House of Commons library report.</a> In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.</p><p>One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?</h2><p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. </p><p>It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.</p><p>However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. </p><p>As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. </p><p>However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.</p><p>Its rulings have sometimes caused <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/22/the-eus-court-is-picking-apart-our-laws/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">controversy</a> in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36534802\" class=\"story-body__link\">immediate legislation</a> to curb its powers. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?</h2><p>BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?</h2><p>The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?</h2><p>They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. </p><p>One of the main principles of EU membership is \"free movement\", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of \"ever closer union\" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a \"United States of Europe\". </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?</h2><p>Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. </p><p>He said the deal would give Britain \"special\" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.</p><p>Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. </p><p>US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?</h2><p>Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. </p><p>They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What about businesses?</h2><p>Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. </p><p>Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36739018\" class=\"story-body__link\">maintain the City's position.</a> But HSBC will <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36629745\" class=\"story-body__link\">move up to 1,000 jobs</a> to Paris, the BBC understands. </p><p>Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.

It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.</p><p><i>Thanks for sending in your questions.

This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.</p><p>If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7213\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">according to a House of Commons library research note</a>. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What will happen to protected species?</h2><p>Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. </p><p>The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  </p><p>The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments? </h2><p>Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about &#163;30m. </p><p>But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of &#163;6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his \"emergency brake\" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?</h2>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">AP</p>\n                \n            </span>\n                <p class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</p>\n                <p class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU\n                </p>\n            \n            \n        <p>Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.

Industry figures have pointed to \"uncertainty\" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.</p><p>So far, the most <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36783938\" class=\"story-body__link\">significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a>, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.</p><p>It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.</p><p>House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.</p><p>Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or &#163;2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.</p><p>Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?</h2><p>Ged, from Liverpool, suspects \"red tape\" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/top-100-eu-rules-cost-britain-33-3bn/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">According to the Open Europe think tank</a>, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs &#163;4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (&#163;4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (&#163;2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.</p><p>There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called \"red tape\" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the \"Norway model\" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership? </h2><p>Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. </p><p>Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of &#163;10bn a year. </p><p>But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. </p><p>Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?</h2><p>Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. </p><p>This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is &#163;350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36040060\" class=\"story-body__link\">The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.</a></p><p>Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.

It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">1. \"The people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit.\"</h2><p>Mr Blair argued that what he called the \"cost\" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on \"imperfect knowledge\" which would now become \"informed knowledge\".</p><p>It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, campaigners from both sides said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">2. \"The practical impact of Brexit on immigration is, on analysis, less than 12% of the immigration total.\"</h2><p>Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.</p><p>He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.</p><p class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n         \n    </p>\n\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n                \n            </span><p>The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.</p><p>Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.</p><p>Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. </p><p>There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">3. \"Seven months ago, after the referendum result, the chancellor was telling us that leaving the single market would be - and I quote - catastrophic.\"</h2><p>This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.</p>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n                \n            </span><p>Mr Hammond said: \"I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.\"</p><p>But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">4. \"Our currency is down around 12% against the euro and 20% against the dollar, which is the international financial market's assessment of our future prosperity ie we are going to be poorer. The price of imported goods in the supermarkets is up and thus the cost of living.\"</h2><p>It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level.

The government has now said that it will have revaluations at least every three years.</p><p>There have been loud complaints from business owners who will have to pay more, but on the Today Programme, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, said: \"Across the country as a whole, far more businesses are benefiting from these changes than are losing out.\"</p><p class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n         \n    </p>\n<p>Mr Gauke is only talking about England because, while there are also revaluation processes underway in Scotland and Wales (Northern Ireland did it in 2015), he has no power over them.</p><p>Business rates are a tax on non-residential property such as pubs, restaurants, warehouses, factories, shops and offices, but not farms or places of worship. </p><p>The amount they pay is based on how much annual rent could be charged on the premises, which is known as the rateable value.</p><p>There have been objections, from some business groups, to changes in the regime for appealing against the rateable value attached to particular premises.</p><p>On average, all areas are seeing their rates fall, except London, where bills will rise an average 11% this year.</p><p>In the 2016 Budget, the government said it would spend &#163;6.7bn on reducing business rates by 2020-21. </p><p>Among the changes, premises with a rateable value of &#163;12,000 or less do not have to pay any rates at all - they previously had to pay 50%. </p><p>The government says that covers about 600,000 businesses.</p><p>The proportion of business rates that must be paid increases gradually, between a rateable value of &#163;12,000 and &#163;15,000, affecting another 50,000 businesses.</p><p>There will also be an increase in the amount businesses can earn before they go from the standard rate to the higher rate.</p><p>The government has also changed the measure of inflation that it uses to increase rates every year - it has switched from the retail prices index (RPI) to the consumer prices index (CPI), which will usually mean smaller increases for businesses.</p><p>And it has introduced transitional arrangements to protect businesses from seeing their rates increasing too much straight away. </p><p>In order to fund this, it has also prevented businesses' rates from falling more than a certain amount.</p><p>The Department for Communities and Local Government says that 520,000 ratepayers will see their bills increase as a result of the revaluation, while 920,000 will see their bills fall and 420,000 will see no change.</p><p>The government says that the revaluation will not earn it any extra money.</p>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n            </span><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/realitycheck\" class=\"story-body__link\">Read more from Reality Check</a></p>\n    </div>", "date": 1487344973000.0}, "terminus": true, "lines": ["Scotland"], "name": "Reality Check: Are there more winners than losers on business rates?"}, {"data": {"img": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/15F68/production/_85506998_gettyimages-487151354.jpg", "title": "The Jeremy Corbyn Story: Profile of Labour leader", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34184265", "summary": "", "html": "<div>\n            <span><img class=\"js-image-replace\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn on his bicycle\" src=\"http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8728/production/_91300643_mediaitem91300642.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\">\n                \n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Reuters</p>\n                \n            </span>\n                <p class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</p>\n                <p class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    He remains in the saddle but not everyone thinks he is heading in the right direction\n                </p>\n            \n            \n        <p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Jeremy Corbyn's election in September 2015 as Labour leader, at the age of 66, counted as one of the biggest upsets in British political history.</p><p>His re-election to the post almost a year later was not such a surprise but could prove even more momentous in terms of Labour's direction in the coming years and the future course of British politics.</p><p>Seeing off the challenge of Owen Smith, who had the backing of the majority of Labour MPs, has made Mr Corbyn, for the time being at least, seemingly unassailable and increased the likelihood that he will lead the opposition into the next general election -

existing budget was being \"abused\" to fund political advocacy and that multilateral spending through external partners, which accounted for 37% of total UK spending in 2015, incurred huge administrative costs.</p><p>The 0.7% spending guarantee, enshrined in law in 2015, was based on \"inaccurate assumptions\" about how best to generate economic development, it said, with aid in some cases providing an obstacle to internal reform and trade innovation.</p><p>\"An increasing body of evidence suggests that more aid is not the best path to prosperity for developing countries but that more trade is,\" said the party's foreign aid spokeswoman Lisa Duffy. </p><p>\"For too long, our government has prioritised ineffective aid spending over its basic obligations to British citizens.\"</p><p>But a spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: \"The UK aid budget invests in our security and prosperity and is a key part of Global Britain's international leadership as we leave the EU.</p><p>\"All DfID programmes and partners are subject to rigorous checks and scrutiny to ensure we reach the world's poorest and most vulnerable, while also achieving the best value for UK taxpayers.\"</p><p>The government has said its assistance is saving thousands of lives in Syria, where the UK is the second largest single donor, and other conflict zones.</p><p>Since 2010, the UK has re-focused its aid budget, with increased spending on countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Somalia seen as critical to regional security and countering the spread of violent Islamic extremism. </p><p>The BBC recently reported a new cross-Whitehall fund is being set up to help poor nations counter Russian influence and Islamic extremism, a

I asked.</p><p>\"I would like that not be the focus of this. I don't really have much comment on that.

rumours he has flatly denied.</p><p>I said the political tone of the manifesto would do little to dampen speculation about where he sees himself longer term.</p><p>Could he imagine himself going into politics? \"I am not doing that now, it's not the plan,\" he said. \"The thing I really care about is connecting the world.\"</p><p>Facebook has been attacked for not doing enough to tackle \"fake news\" - untrue stories which claimed, for example, that the Pope backed Mr Trump - which have appeared prominently on its news feeds.</p><p>In Germany, there has been controversy after a Green MP was quoted in a Facebook post defending an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who had raped and murdered a German student.</p><p>The MP, Renate Kuenast, had never said what was attributed to her by a right-wing extremist organisation.</p><p>Ms Kuenast said she found it hard to accept that \"Zuckerberg earns billions, shows off with all his charitable donations, and at the same time allows Facebook to become a tool of extremists\".</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg said he understood the importance of tackling fake news.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Freedom of opinion</h2><p>\"Accuracy of information is very important,\" he said in the 5,500-word letter, published on Thursday. \"We know there is misinformation and even outright hoax content on Facebook.</p><p>\"We've made progress fighting hoaxes the way we fight spam, but we have more work to do.</p><p>\"We are proceeding carefully because there is not always a clear line between hoaxes, satire and opinion.\"</p><p>But Mr Zuckerberg added: \"In a free society, it's important that people have the power to share their opinion, even if others think they're wrong.</p><p>\"Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation, and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information, including that fact checkers dispute an item's accuracy.\"</p>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n                \n            </span><p>He told me that \"polarisation and sensationalism\" also undermined \"common understanding\".</p><p>And he admitted that social media - which deals in short, often aggressive, messages - had been part of the problem.</p><p>\"In some places [it] could over simplify important and complex topics and may push us to have over simplified opinions of them,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.</p><p>\"And I think it is our responsibility to amplify the good effects and mitigate the negative ones so we can create a community that has a common understanding</p><p>\"There is a lot of research that shows we have the best discourse when we connect as whole people rather than just opinions.</p><p>\"If I get to know you on the values that we have in common or even the interests that we share it is a lot easier to have a debate about something that we disagree about productively than if we just meet and go head to head on something without understanding our common humanity.\"</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">'Setting an example'</h2><p>Some may argue there is a question of legitimacy here, that no one voted for Mark Zuckerberg and question his right to outline - and attempt to execute - a vision of the world.</p><p>And what about those controversies over taxes paid, or privacy, or vast profits in an age when inequality is as much a factor behind the present dim view of many in the political and business establishment as any perceived failures of globalisation.</p><p>\"There are a lot of areas that I know we need to improve and I appreciate the criticism and feedback and hope we can continue to do better on them,\" Mr Zuckerberg said, pointing out that he is donating 99% of his Facebook shares - worth &#163;36bn ($45bn) - to the charitable foundation he runs with his wife, Priscilla Chan.</p><p>\"Being a good corporate citizen is really important,\" he said. \"We operate in a lot of different countries all around the world.</p><p>\"We need to be help build those communities and that is what I am trying to do in my personal philanthropy - setting an example hopefully for other entrepreneurs who will build things in the future for how you should give back to the community and to the world.</p><p>\"I care deeply about all of this, and it is a work in progress.\"</p>\n    </div>", "date": 1487278870000.0}, "terminus": false, "lines": ["Facebook"], "name": "Zuckerberg: My Facebook manifesto to re-boot globalisation"}, {"data": {"img": "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4C5C/production/_94684591_p04t4cfh.jpg", "title": "What Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg told the BBC", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39000113", "summary": "", "html": "<div><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg spoke to the BBC's Kamal Ahmed off-camera. </p><p>He told him that fake news, polarised views and \"filter bubbles\" were damaging \"common understanding\".</p><p><i>Video produced by Alexi Peristianis</i></p>\n   <h2>Read more</h2>    <a href=\"/news/business-38998884\"><p class=\"cta\">Zuckerberg: My Facebook manifesto to re-boot globalisation</p></a>   </div>", "date": 1487284338000.0}, "terminus": false, "lines": ["Facebook"], "name": "What Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg told the BBC"}, {"data": {"img": "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/75D3/production/_94636103_connor4.jpg", "title": "Facebook bereavement leave: How long is long enough?", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38915693", "summary": "", "html": "<div>\n            <span><img class=\"js-image-replace\" alt=\"Facebook's new bereavement leave policy was announced by chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg\" src=\"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A517/production/_94636224_sherylfb.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\">\n                \n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n                \n            </span>\n                <p class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</p>\n                <p class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Facebook's new bereavement leave policy was announced by Sheryl Sandberg\n                </p>\n            \n            \n        <p class=\"story-body__introduction\">Facebook last week doubled its bereavement leave allowance for its staff.

Twenty days amounts to nearly 10% of the working year, which he says would be \"excessive\" if it became law. </p><p>His concern is that it would put pressure on employers to increase other categories of leave too. \"This could have a knock-on effect which could make companies uncompetitive,\" he says.</p><p>He favours a \"sensible, minimum standard which the government prescribes and the discretion to give more leave on a case-by-case basis\".</p><p>Ten years ago, he granted three months' paid leave to an indigenous employee on cultural grounds.</p><p>Mr Wilson says most employers will extend leave provisions where there's a good case for it.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">A headhunter</h2>\n            <span><p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\"></p>\n                \n                \n                 <p class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</p>\n                 <p class=\"story-image-copyright\">Dan Clements</p>\n                \n            </span>\n                <p class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</p>\n                <p class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    A company's compassionate leave policy can give an insight into its ethics, says headhunter Dan Clements\n                </p>\n            \n            \n        <p>Dan Clements is the managing director of the technology executive recruitment firm, Identify, and says most people probably do not factor in bereavement leave when they are deciding whether to join a company.</p><p>However, he believes a firm's compassionate leave policy could give potential employees insight into its culture and ethics.
