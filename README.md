# NewsGraph

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/damasktb/NewsGraph.svg?token=t8SUpq2tFb6x2ycwG1px&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/damasktb/NewsGraph)

This is my Final Year Project for CM30082 (University of Bath, BSc Computer Science, class of 2017.)

Hopefully, this will one day be a tool you can use to contextually explore the days' news (think [Shahaf et al.](http://metro.ezyang.com) but for RSS feeds) but for now it needs some manual tweaking when you run it.

## Installing

1. Clone this repo 
2. (Optionally) activate your virtualenv 
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This was developed in OS X 10.12 and hasn't been tested on any other platform, but in theory it should work fine.
