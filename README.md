# NewsGraph

This is my Dissertation code for CM30082 (University of Bath, BSc Computer Science, class of 2017.)

Hopefully, this will one day be a tool you can use to contextually explore the days' news (think [_Shahaf et al._](http://metro.ezyang.com) but for RSS feeds) but for now it needs some manual tweaking when you run it.

## Installing

1. Clone this repo 
2. (Optionally) activate your virtualenv 
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This was developed in OS X 10.12 and hasn't been tested on any other platform, but in theory it should work fine.
